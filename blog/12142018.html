  <p> I didn't do shit today. Woke up late, and started my day at only like 2. After that, I decided to go gas at like 4, and the rest of the day was spent at Vishaal's house. No hyperloop, no work, no nothing done. I have to plan stuff to do still. Plus I have a final exam due Sunday.</p>
  <p> In fact, I was so lazy today, that I didn't even write this on the 14th or 15th, and I am instead filling in the blanks from the 16th. </p>
