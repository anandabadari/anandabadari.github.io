  <h1>December 13th, 2018</h1>
  <p>       12.14.18 is when I am actually writing, but who cares since it is still about my day on the 13th. Today is the day 0 for the next 23 days, and I hope to keep writing atleast a little bit every day atleast. Today was fine, I finally finished off my last final, Math 3406 Linear Algebra, and to be honest, it was a bit tougher than I expected. I talked to the asian guy sitting next to me after the final, and he told me that he is about to graduate. Imagine that, me taking the final as a first semester student, barely even 18, and this guy is probably 27 having been in school for 10 years. </p>    
  <p>       Things like that give me hope for the future, I have still about 4-5 years before I truly have to be a full blown adult. I guess that includes not gassing, and that might be the hardest thing to deal with right now. Its day 0 and I am already craving it. It is definitely not going to be easy to hold out for the next 23 days, especially with Jeremy or Shawn asking me to do it every day. I know that gassing is obviously bad for your health and for your brain, and at this point, with the tolerance to it that I have, it acts more like a sedative than anything fun. I honestly can't wait to reset my tolerance. I still have to find what my healthy understanding with it is, and for right now, I am going to limit it to once a week nights starting January. However, until then I need to make sure I stay sober. I work best when I am sober, and there is definitely a lot of work to do.</p>
    <p>     First and foremost on things to do is Hyperloop. I am so greatful for hyperloop, since it has basically saved me from a wasted semester. However, all hope is not lost. It is only the 14th, and I think the next 3 days I can get a lot done. The unofficial due date for Hyperloop is <mark> December 17th</mark>. </p>
