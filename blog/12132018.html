  <h1>Ananda Badari</h1>
  <h2>December 13th, 2018 <a href="/blog">.</a> <small> <a href="/blog/12142018.html">tmrw.</a> </small></h2>
  
  <p> 12.14.18 is when I am actually writing, but who cares since it is still about my day on the 13th. Today is the day 0 for the next 23 days, and I hope to keep writing atleast a little bit every day atleast. Today was fine, I finally finished off my last final, Math 3406 Linear Algebra, and to be honest, it was a bit tougher than I expected. I talked to the asian guy sitting next to me after the final, and he told me that he is about to graduate. Imagine that, me taking the final as a first semester student, barely even 18, and this guy is probably 27 having been in school for 10 years. </p>    
  <p> Things like that give me hope for the future, I have still about 4-5 years before I truly have to be a full blown adult. I guess that includes not gassing, and that might be the hardest thing to deal with right now. Its day 0 and I am already craving it. It is definitely not going to be easy to hold out for the next 23 days, especially with Jeremy or Shawn asking me to do it every day. I know that gassing is obviously bad for your health and for your brain, and at this point, with the tolerance to it that I have, it acts more like a sedative than anything fun. I honestly can't wait to reset my tolerance. I still have to find what my healthy understanding with it is, and for right now, I am going to limit it to once a week nights starting January. However, until then I need to make sure I stay sober. I work best when I am sober, and there is definitely a lot of work to do.</p>
    
  <h3> hyperloop </h3>
  
  <p> First and foremost on things to do is Hyperloop. I am so greatful for hyperloop, since it has basically saved me from a wasted semester. However, all hope is not lost. It is only the 14th, and I think the next 3 days I can get a lot done. The unofficial due date for Hyperloop is <mark> December 17th</mark>. There sure is a lot to do. First, I have to deconstruct the state diagram, and reconstruct it based on each state and each transition. Basically, my job is to make a transition table based on the state machine that I created for the pod. I need to know the kinds of sensors being used, the data type I will recieve from each one, and how often I will recieve that data. Then, I need to start mapping how things could go wrong and fix them. I think I am going to approach this as thorugh I am writing a paper for it. I am going to start off with a list of sensors and data that could be used from the sensors. Then, I will detain step by step in a linear order a perfect run. Then I will have to fill in all the small details in the transition table to understand any non-perfect runs. At this point, I need to make sure to make any changes that I need to ensure that the pod functions as designed. In order to do this, I also need to keep track of what my inputs and outputs for each element and for the entire state machine is. </p>
  <p> This is not all I have to do, I also have to basically design and handle all navigation systems. That includes retroreflective sensor, how data from the sensor is going to be used in calculation of speed and acceleration. The due date on this kind of thing can be further than the 17th of December, but I wouldn't put it off until after Christmas. My unofficial due date for this is <mark> December 20th. </mark> Another big thing that I can do to help out Hyperloop is to actually learn some code. </p>
  
  <h3> coding </h3>
  
  <p>I have already beeen exposed to coding through AP Computer Science, and althought I did well in that, I hope to adopt this as my new Mathematics. In order to start off, I decided to learn Java by taking a methodical approach to learning it. I am also interested in learning some bootstrap (for obvious reasons), but I am planning on pursuing that more as a hobby, and learning more stuff about that just as my interest grows and I have more things I want to add to this website. Along with this comes buying my own domain name: anandabadari.com. However, my main goal, the end goal, the big longer term goal for me in this avenue is to be proficient in C++. Clearly, I want to be a computer scientist for the money, but I don't want to live a mediocre wealth life. In order to set myself up for better job offers and better opportunities in the future, I need to make sure I plan out and carry out side projects that I take up just for fun. A good way to keep myself motivated is try to do this with Vivek, since he is one of the only people that actually has some ambition. However, the longevity is an issue, and I can't let his failures affect my performance. This seems to happen with most of my major goals, including money spending and gassing. </p>
  <p> I want to do research, hackathons, and projects with programming so that eventually I can get a good job. A good set up for having a nice job is going through the CS/Math major. All I did today, is download JDK and IntelliJ and set it up with Vivek. I am currently sleepy as shit and will have to finish writing about the rest of this tomorrow.
