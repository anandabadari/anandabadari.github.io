  <h1>December 13th, 2018</h1>
  <p> /t 12.14.18 is when I am actually writing, but who cares since it is still about my day on the 13th. Today is the day 0 for the next 23 days, and I hope to keep writing atleast a little bit every day atleast. Today was fine, I finally finished off my last final, Math 3406 Linear Algebra, and to be honest, it was a bit tougher than I expected. I talked to the asian guy sitting next to me after the final, and he told me that he is about to graduate. Imagine that, me taking the final as a first semester student, barely even 18, and this guy is probably 27 having been in school for 10 years. </p>    
  <p>Things like that give me hope for the future, </p>
