 <p> Waste of a day. Woke up late again, but I was still sleepy throughout the day. No java done, no hyperloop done, no website update. Instead I took a nap for about 4 hours and that wasted the entire day. In the evening, although I didn't get any work done, my grandparents came over, and are probably going to stay at my house for a couple weeks atleast, so atleast I will be entertained during my christmas break. One positive thing about today is that I didn't gas, and that I qualified for a 3000 Swagbuck Survevy on the 19th. </p>
  
  <p> Hopefully tomorrow will be more fruitful </p>
